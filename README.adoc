== Deny Wildcard Subscription Plugin

NOTE: HiveMQ 4 uses a new extension system. This HiveMQ 3 plugin is not compatible with HiveMQ 4. The new version can be found {extension}[here].

This plugin denies any subscription to the root wildcard topic. In general, root wildcard subscribers tend to be a bottleneck in many scenarios.

Any client who wants to subscribe to the root level wildcard will be disconnected immediately.

=== Installation

1. Copy the jar file to your +<HIVEMQ_HOME>/plugins+ folder
2. Done

=== Configuration

No configuration needed, works out of the box.
